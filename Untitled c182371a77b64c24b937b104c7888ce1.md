# Bootstrap

Bootstrap is a popular open-source front-end framework that helps developers build responsive and visually appealing websites and web applications. It provides a collection of pre-designed HTML, CSS, and JavaScript components and utilities that can be easily customized and integrated into projects.

Bootstrap compiled files include :

- Compiled and minified CSS bundles. it is a Sass file which provides additional features such as variables, nesting, mixing, and functions, which make it easier to write and maintain CSS code. It allows for reusable styles, easier management of color schemes and typography, and more flexible and modular stylesheets.
- Compiled and minified JavaScript plugins

Break points in bootstrap are the following:

There are two types of containers in Bootstrap: **`.container`** and **`.container-fluid`**.

1. **`.container`**: This class creates a fixed-width container that adapts its width based on the viewport size. The content inside a **`.container`** is centered horizontally on the page. It has predefined maximum widths for different breakpoints, ensuring that the layout remains responsive.
2. **`.container-fluid`**: This class creates a full-width container that spans the entire width of the viewport. The content inside a **`.container-fluid`** extends to the edges of the screen. It adjusts its width dynamically as the viewport size changes.
3. **` .container-{breakpoint}, which is width: 100% until the specified breakpoint. Break points are the break point of the above

## Bootstrap grid

~~the bootstrap grid divide our container in to 12 equal columns And we can use the prefixes~~

~~of the above containers to make our columns more responsive on different screen and sizes.~~

the bootstrap grid divide our container in to 12 equal columns And we can use the prefixes of the above containers to make our columns more responsive on different screen and sizes. we use all types of container for grid parent and then use .col classes to make divide the container in to needed sizes. we can also use prefixes of the container to make it responsive

**Columns**

1. **`col`**: This is a generic column class that can be used for creating equal-width columns.
2. **`col-{breakpoint}-{number}`**: This class is used to create columns of specific width based on the specified breakpoint. For example, **`col-sm-4`** creates a column that occupies 4 units of the grid on small screens and above.
3. **`col-{breakpoint}-auto`**: This class creates a column that automatically adjusts its width based on the content within it.
4. **`col-{breakpoint}-offset-{number}`**: This class is used to offset columns horizontally by the specified number of units at the specified breakpoint.

**Gutters**

are used to give space between grid columns horizontally and vertically

`.gx-*` classes can be used to control the horizontal gutter widths.

`.gy-*` classes can be used to control the vertical gutter widths within a row when columns wrap to new lines

## Bootstrap Components

Bootstrap provides a rich collection of pre-designed components that you can readily use to build various elements and features for your web pages. These components are designed to be responsive, customizable, and consistent in their appearance. Here are some commonly used Bootstrap components:

## **Core concepts**

- **Breakpoints are the building blocks of responsive design.** Use them to control when your layout can be adapted at a particular viewport or device size.
- **Use media queries to architect your CSS by breakpoint.** Media queries are a feature of CSS that allow you to conditionally apply styles based on a set of browser and operating system parameters. We most commonly use `min-width` in our media queries.
- **Mobile first, responsive design is the goal.** Bootstrap’s CSS aims to apply the bare minimum of styles to make a layout work at the smallest breakpoint, and then layers on styles to adjust that design for larger devices. This optimizes your CSS, improves rendering time, and provides a great experience for your visitors.

## **Available breakpoints**

Bootstrap includes six default breakpoints, sometimes referred to as *grid tiers*, for building responsively. These breakpoints can be customized if you’re using our source Sass files.

| Breakpoint | Class infix | Dimensions |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Extra small | None | <576px |
| Small | sm | ≥576px |
| Medium | md | ≥768px |
| Large | lg | ≥992px |
| Extra large | xl | ≥1200px |
| Extra extra large | xxl | ≥1400px |

Each breakpoint was chosen to comfortably hold containers whose widths are multiples of 12. Breakpoints are also representative of a subset of common device sizes and viewport dimensions—they don’t specifically target every use case or device. Instead, the ranges provide a strong and consistent foundation to build on for nearly any device.

These breakpoints are customizable via Sass—you’ll find them in a Sass map in our `_variables.scss` stylesheet.
